Description: A suite of functions for extracting results from multinomial
    logistic regression models when data is clustered (eg, by subject). Models
    can be fit using sandwich estimation or the bootstrap, and can use complete
    case analysis or multiple imputation. Results can include odds ratios and
    confidence limits; predicted probabilities and confidence limits; and
    p-values for individual variables or groups of variables.
